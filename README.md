## Introduction

- Due date: Check Discord or the [Course Materials Schedule](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-spring-2024/course-materials/blob/main/Schedule.md)
- This assignment is pass/fail. 100%(0%) is earned for a gatorgrade score of 100%(<100%) as
described in the syllabus section for
[Assignment Evaluation](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-spring-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#assignment-evaluation)
- Submit this assignment on GitHub following the expectations in the syllabus on
[Assignment Submission](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-spring-2024/course-materials#assignment-submission).
- To begin, read this `README` and the Proactive Programmers' project
description for
[Numerical Data](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/source-code-surveys/numerical-data/)
- This project has been adapted from Proactive Programmers' material, thus discrepancies are possible.
- Post to the #data-structures Discord channel for questions and clarifications.

## Seeking Assistance

Please review the course expectations on the syllabus about
[Seeking Assistance](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-spring-2024/course-materials#seeking-assistance).
Students are reminded
to uphold the Honor Code. Cloning the assignment repository is a
commitment to the latter.

For this assignment, you may use class materials, textbooks, notes, and the
internet. Ensure that your writing is original and based on your own understanding
of the concepts. Examples of plagiarism include:

- verbatim copying without citation
- copying with single word modifications
- paraphrasing sections or notes from a source without citation

To claim that work is your own, it is essential to craft the logic and the
writing together without copying or using the logical structure of another
source. The honor code holds everyone to this standard.

## Objectives

1. Use git, GitHub, VS Code effectively to explore source code
2. Run python scripts
3. Read about number representations
4. Review Python foundations

## Project Overview

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following
steps:

- Open the
  [instructions](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/source-code-surveys/numerical-data/)
  on the Proactive Programmers web site for reference.
- Use the `cd` command to change into the top directory for this repository.
- run `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml` and check whether
  the output matches the gatorgrade output reported in GitHub actions.
  - if they do not match, post or check replies in Discord
- Change into the program source code directory by typing `cd source`.
- Run the provided Python scripts by typing the following:
  - `python determine-even-odd.py`: demonstrate computation with integer values and modular arithmetic
  - `python floating-point-confusion.py`: demonstrate computation with floating-point values
- Confirm that the programs are producing the expected output.
- Make sure that you can explain why the programs produce the output that they do.
- Don't forget to provide all of the required responses to the technical writing
  prompts in the `writing/reflection.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers
- Add your own comments to demonstrate
  that you understand all of the source code in this project.
- Please make sure that you also completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  instructions from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file to create a
  polished file.
