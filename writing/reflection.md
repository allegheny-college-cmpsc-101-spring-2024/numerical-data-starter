TODO: Provide responses for the TODOs.

Make sure that all aspects of the `writing/reflection.md` correctly use all
of the features of the Markdown standard. This means that, when you preview your
Markdown it should always be formatted in a suitable fashion. For VS Code previews,
right click on the tab that shows the file name (e.g. `reflection.md`), then select
Open Preview.

Please make sure that you completely delete the TODO markers
from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file.

Ensure that your writing is original and based on your own understanding
of the concepts. Examples of plagiarism include:

- verbatim copying without citation
- copying with single word modifications
- paraphrasing sections or notes from a source without citation

To claim that work is your own, it is essential to craft the logic and the
writing together without copying or using the logical structure of another
source. The honor code holds everyone to this standard.

## Program Output

### What is the output from running the following command?

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.
Since the content in the code block is actually coming from the terminal,
tag it with cmd.

- `python determine-even-odd.py`

### What is the output from running the following command?

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.
Since the content in the code block is actually coming from the terminal,
tag it with cmd.

- `python floating-point-confusion.py`

## Program Understanding

### What is the purpose of the `%` operator in a Python program?

TODO: Provide a response to this question.

### What are the inputs and outputs of the `determine_even_odd` function?

TODO: Provide a response to this question.

### Does the computation `10.0 * 0.1` produce the value of `1.0`? Why?

TODO: Provide a response to this question. Cite any references used.

### Does the additive computation in the `floating-point-confusion` produce the value of `1.0`? Why or why not?

TODO: Provide a response to this question.

NOTE: For your reference, here is the source code that does the additive computation:

```python
for _ in range(10):
    number = number + 0.1
```

### What is the `_` in the loop above?

TODO: Provide a response to this question. Cite any references used.

### Do these files define a command line interface?

TODO: Provide a response to this question. Cite any references used.

### Show the function signature that had input and output type annotations

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide what the function signature.
Since the content in the code block is actually coming from source code,
tag it with python.

### What are the benefits and downsides associated with using type annotations?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response to this question.
 Cite any references used.

## References

TODO: Use a Markdown list to provide referenced materials. Links are sufficient.
